    <p>&lt;p&gt;Powerful storm systems bring heavy rainfall, widespread flooding and landslides to Central America and Asia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tropical Storm Sara has caused significant disruption across Central America in recent days after forming in the Caribbean Sea &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/florida-tropical-storm-sara&quot;&gt;on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. It is the 18th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the third this month. The large number of tropical storm and hurricane formations this season can be attributed to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico being warmer than average, thus providing more energy for the development and intensification of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its formation, Sara has affected Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize and Guatemala, bringing heavy rainfall, widespread flooding and landslides. The slow-moving nature of the storm has exacerbated the damage, prolonging the duration of its impact. However, Sara is losing strength; initially it had sustained winds of 45mph on Thursday but weakened slightly after moving inland, with winds dropping to 40mph by Sunday. According to the National Hurricane Centre, Sara is expected to dissipate into an area of low pressure as it moves north-west toward the southern region of the Yucatan peninsula on Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/18/weather-tracker-tropical-storm-sara-super-typhoon-man-yi-wreak-havoc&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;Military and political consequences of allowing Kyiv to use Atacms missiles remain uncertain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has taken an election defeat in the US and the arrival of 10,000 North Koreans in Ukraine for Joe Biden to finally relent. After two years of asking, Ukraine’s army has been given permission to use US long-range Atacms missiles to strike against targets inside Russia. The military and political consequences remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has been able to bomb targets across all of Ukraine throughout the war. On Sunday it attacked key sites across the country’s power network, forcing Kyiv to implement national electricity rationing as a result of the damage caused. Some missiles were aimed as far west as Lviv and at sites near the border with Moldova, and an energy crisis is closer as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/letting-ukraine-fire-missiles-into-russia-unlikely-to-have-decisive-effect&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>
