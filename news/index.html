    <p>&lt;p&gt;This week a flurry of controversial and extremist picks for Trump’s cabinet came at a hectic pace with a level of provocation that made heads spin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Welcome back,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden&quot;&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, his predecessor and successor, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/biden-trump-transition-white-house&quot;&gt;the pair shook hands&lt;/a&gt; in the Oval Office. For Biden, it was important to show the world that America can still conduct a peaceful transfer of power. “A transition that’s so smooth it’ll be as smooth as it can get,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an outward show of permanence and stability. But behind the two men a fire was burning fiercely in the grate. TV comedian Stephen Colbert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yF8KJwR0c&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt;: “I do think it was fitting that they held the meeting in front of a roaring metaphor for the future.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/trump-transition-biden&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;The tradition of chomping through a kilo of sweets once a week is under threat as demand soars for sugary sweets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swedes love sweets. So when an American TikToker sparked a craze for Swedish candy this year, there was pride that an important part of national culture was being recognised around the world. The Danes may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/20/from-fashion-to-the-food-industry-11-ways-that-weight-loss-drugs-have-changed-the-world&quot;&gt;have Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; but the Swedes have &lt;em&gt;lördagsgodis&lt;/em&gt; – Saturday sweets – where families chew through more than 1kg of sticky treats in an evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pride has given way to some irritation. Supplies of some Swedish sweets ran dry in the autumn due to the high demand in the US, South Korea and in Scandinavia. And there was another factor, an equally important Swedish tradition: the six-week summer holiday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/17/swedes-left-longing-for-sweets-as-viral-tiktok-starts-craze-for-candy&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>
