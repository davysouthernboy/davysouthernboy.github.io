    <p>&lt;p&gt;Damage to fictional gravesite, seen in 1984 adaptation of Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, discovered on Sunday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marley was dead: to begin with,” begins Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, the ghostly morality tale of miserly Ebenezer Scrooge who, through a series of encounters with spirits in the early hours of Christmas morning, realises he needs to change his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an imagined story – there is no Scrooge and, unlike his unfortunate business partner, he is not dead. But that does not appear to have mattered to a vandal in Shropshire, where a gravestone of Scrooge used in a 1984 film adaptation has been smashed into multiple pieces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/25/humbug-vandal-smashes-gravestone-of-ebenezer-scrooge&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>
