    <p>&lt;p&gt;The tradition of chomping through a kilo of sweets once a week is under threat as demand soars for sugary sweets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swedes love sweets. So when an American TikToker sparked a craze for Swedish candy this year, there was pride that an important part of national culture was being recognised around the world. The Danes may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/20/from-fashion-to-the-food-industry-11-ways-that-weight-loss-drugs-have-changed-the-world&quot;&gt;have Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; but the Swedes have &lt;em&gt;lördagsgodis&lt;/em&gt; – Saturday sweets – where families chew through more than 1kg of sticky treats in an evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pride has given way to some irritation. Supplies of some Swedish sweets ran dry in the autumn due to the high demand in the US, South Korea and in Scandinavia. And there was another factor, an equally important Swedish tradition: the six-week summer holiday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/17/swedes-left-longing-for-sweets-as-viral-tiktok-starts-craze-for-candy&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;Senior official Bassem Naim says militant group ‘ready for ceasefire’ and urges Donald Trump to ‘pressure’ &#39;Israel to ‘end the aggression’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, is reporting that two Palestinian people were killed in an Israeli artillery attack in &lt;strong&gt;Beit Lahiya&lt;/strong&gt; in northern Gaza. Three other Palestinians were killed in a separate Israeli airstrike near the general security junction in western &lt;strong&gt;Gaza City&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/151668&quot;&gt;according to Wafa&lt;/a&gt;. A renewed Israeli assault was launched on the northern part of the Gaza Strip last month, with the Israeli military claiming it was to stop Hamas fighters regrouping there. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77x05l5ze4o&quot;&gt;blockage of aid and food deliveries&lt;/a&gt; and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, however, have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. The entirety of northern Gaza has been under Israeli evacuation orders but it is unclear how many people remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have some comments coming through from &lt;strong&gt;Ali Larijani&lt;/strong&gt;, the senior advisor to Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/15/middle-east-latest-lebanon-israel-gaza-hamas-hezbollah?page=with:block-67371cb48f08a588f0fa6f05#block-67371cb48f08a588f0fa6f05&quot;&gt;He has been speaking with&lt;/a&gt; Lebanese parliament speaker &lt;strong&gt;Nabih Berri&lt;/strong&gt; and Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, in Beiurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/15/middle-east-latest-lebanon-israel-gaza-hamas-hezbollah&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>
