    <p>&lt;p&gt;Tsai Ing-wen says Kyiv needs weapons more urgently than Taipei and says Ukrainian victory will be ‘effective deterrent to future aggression’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s former president urges US to prioritise aiding Ukraine over Taiwan for now, says report. &lt;/strong&gt;Former Taiwanese president&lt;strong&gt; Tsai Ing-wen &lt;/strong&gt;has suggested that the US should prioritise helping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; over Taiwan – in the immediate future – as Kyiv needs weapons more urgently than Taipei. Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, the former Taiwanese leader was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/23/taiwans-former-president-says-ukraine-needs-u-s-weapons-more-urgently-than-taipei-00191400&quot;&gt;quoted by Politico&lt;/a&gt; as saying: “They should do whatever they can to help the Ukrainians … We [Taiwan] still have time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moscow offers debt forgiveness to new recruits. Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; has signed a law granting debt forgiveness to new army recruits who enlist to fight in Moscow’s war on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. According to Russian state news agency Interfax, the new legislation allows those signing up for a one-year contract to write off bad debts of up to 10 million rubles ($96,000; £77,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An air alert has been sounded ‘almost daily’ across Ukraine this week, Ukrainian president&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Volodymyr Zelenskyy says as he pleads for more air defences. &lt;/strong&gt;Zelenskyy has posted to Telegram saying that his country needs more air defences to protect itself against relentless Russian attacks. He said that Russia used more than 800 guided aerial bombs, about 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia prepared to launch cyber-attacks on UK, minister to warn. &lt;/strong&gt;Russia is prepared to launch a series of cyber-attacks on Britain and other Nato members as it seeks to weaken support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, a senior UK cabinet minister will warn in a speech on Monday. Moscow will “not think twice” about exploiting defence gaps to target UK businesses, and allies must “not underestimate” the threat it poses, &lt;strong&gt;Pat McFadden&lt;/strong&gt;, a senior UK minister whose portfolio includes national security, will say. In a speech to the Nato cyber defence conference at Lancaster House, the minister is expected to say: “Military hard-power is one thing. But cyberwar can be destabilising and debilitating. With a cyber-attack, Russia can turn the lights off for millions of people. It can shut down the power grids. This is the hidden war Russia is waging with Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No ‘red lines’ when it comes to support for Ukraine, France’s foreign minister says. &lt;/strong&gt;The French foreign minister, &lt;strong&gt;Jean-Noël Barrot&lt;/strong&gt;, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; against Russia, and “not set and express red lines”. Barrot’s comments are significant, coming a few days after US and UK long-range missiles &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/ukraine-uk-missiles-strike-russia&quot;&gt;were used in that way for the first time.&lt;/a&gt; Barrot said that Ukraine could fire French long-range missiles into Russia “in the logics of self-defence”, but would not confirm if French weapons had already been used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; has signed a law granting debt forgiveness to new army recruits who enlist to fight in Moscow’s war on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-french-foreign-minister-says-there-should-be-no-red-lines-in-supporting-ukraine&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;Meeting comes amid fears Middle East tensions will lead Iran to redouble its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, will meet his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday after the collapse of a deal last week under which Iran would have limited its uranium enrichment to 60% purity, just below the threshold to make nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer was regarded by Iran as a first step to rebuilding confidence between it and the west over what it insists is its civilian nuclear programme. There are growing fears that wider tensions in the Middle East could result in Tehran redoubling efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon and trying to declare it necessary for its national self-defence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/24/iranian-minister-to-meet-european-counterparts-after-talks-on-nuclear-deal-collapse&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;Trump grew his support in nearly all of Philadelphia’s wards – what went wrong for Harris in a key Democratic city?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kamala Harris stopped at the west Philadelphia barber shop Philly Cuts just days before the election, its manager, James Browne, said the vice-president came off “almost like a favorite aunt”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris seemed “genuine, kind, nice, very comforting” during the half-hour she spent in the shop while campaigning in the largest city in battleground state Pennsylvania, Browne said. “Meeting her in person was very different than seeing her on TV.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/24/democrats-harris-philadelphia-trump&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;Trump voters in the American heartland are excited, even as senior Republicans are less than enthusiastic about some of the president-elect’s choices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the American heartland, they’re excited. Finally, say voters who put Donald Trump into the White House for a second time, they are about to get the president they wanted all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as leading Democrats decry Trump’s cabinet nominations as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/20/trump-cabinet-picks-contempt-rage-vengeance&quot;&gt;agents of his contempt, rage and vengeance&lt;/a&gt;”, the former and future president’s supporters are interpreting the selections as evidence that he has finally broken free of the Washington establishment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/24/trump-supporters-react-cabinet-picks&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;The US doesn’t need to spend more on Ukraine. Britain can bring funding to the table – and help Trump reboot alliances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump the very meaning of words is up for negotiation. What does he really mean when he promises to “build a wall”? When he pledges to end the Russo-Ukrainian war in one day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His supporters say they don’t take him literally but seriously – but who decides what “serious” is? The very ambiguity can be part of Trump’s appeal. There’s something exhilarating in the sense one is in an exclusive negotiation with the president to define reality. It’s as if he’s welcoming you backstage from the reality show of politics to the discrete board room where meaning is made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/24/trump-depends-on-the-eu-and-uk-to-act-as-peacemakers-more-than-he-thinks&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>
